# AI-assisted development disclosure

Version 1 of the asthma and air-pollution analysis reflects my original 2021 Ironhack Data Analytics bootcamp work. I preserve the original notebook and write-up so that the historical work can be compared with later revisions.

In 2026, I used Cursor's coding agent to help restructure this repository, implement and test Version 2 of the analysis, create the Streamlit dashboard, audit scientific claims, improve documentation, and build the local evidence assistant. I developed these changes iteratively through prompts under my direction.

My role included choosing the research and engineering questions, supplying project context, reviewing code diffs and interpretations, running local commands, checking source material, and validating the published outputs. The coding agent assisted with code and prose generation; I do not claim that I manually authored every line, and the agent did not conduct independent research without my review and oversight.

Generated code and prose were tested, checked against repository evidence, and revised before publication. AI assistance is a development method, not evidence that a scientific claim is valid. I retain responsibility for the material published in this repository.

The original project files remain available in [`projects/asthma-air-pollution/v1/`](projects/asthma-air-pollution/v1/) and [`archive/bootcamp-original/`](archive/bootcamp-original/) for comparison and provenance.

The [local cited evidence assistant](projects/local-llm-demo/README.md) documents an honest privacy framing: the current corpus is public aggregate CDC PLACES county evidence, while local inference remains a relevant pattern for future confidential health-science corpora that must stay inside institutional boundaries. That section now cites example asthma mHealth and ResearchKit-style studies with denser personal tracking as **motivation for the architecture**, not as claims about the current 67-county demo dataset.
